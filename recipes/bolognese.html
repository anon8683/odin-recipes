<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan. She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought 'Bolognese' was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.</p>
<h4>Ingrediants list:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
    <li>2 cups white wine</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups 2% milk</li>
    <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>½ cup finely diced carrot</li>
    <li>½ cup finely diced celery</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook onion, celery, and carrot with pinch of salt until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef into vegetables and cook, stirring constantly until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season meat mixture with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until most of the milk has evaporated and bottom of pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Raise heat to medium high and pour white wine into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until white wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 more minutes.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl and crush them with your fingers until they resemble a slightly chunky sauce. Pour tomatoes into sauce; fill can with 2 cups water and add to sauce. Bring to a simmer.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from top of sauce if desired. If sauce is too thick or too hot on the bottom, add a little more water. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.<br/><br/></li>
